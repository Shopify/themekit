# Releasing Theme Kit

To release a new version of Theme Kit, make sure to complete all of the following steps.

## 1. Update the Theme Kit version

1. Update `ThemeKitVersion` in `src/release/release.go` and commit your changes.
2. Make the release tool by running `go install ./cmd/tkrelease`.
3. Run `git tag <version> && git push origin --tags && git push`.
4. Update `changelog.txt` with the date of the version release.

## 2. Release using tool

1. Build all distributions by running `make all`.
2. Release `tkrelease -k="AWS_ACCESS_KEY" -s="AWS_SECRET_KEY" vX.X.X`.

    > Note:
    > If you're releasing a different version than in `src/release/version.go`, then you can use `-f` to force. Sometimes this is necessary for specific issue tags like `v0.0.0-issue432` when trying to debug a issue.
    > Using beta/alpha tags on the version number will stop `themekit` from automatically updating to that version. It would have to be typed in specifically (for example, `theme update --version=v1.0.4-rc1`).

## 3. Create a new release on GitHub

1. In GitHub, create a new release for the tag.
2. Include a brief summary of all the changes pertaining to the release.
3. Include links to the pull requests that introduced the changes.
4. Upload the binary files and include the md5 checksums in the description.

## 4. Update the Theme Kit documentation on shopify.dev

1. Open a [pull request in shopify-dev](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-dev/pulls) to update the [Theme Kit documentation](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit).
2. Commit your changes and tag the partner-facing docs team ([@Shopify/dev-docs](https://github.com/orgs/Shopify/teams/dev-docs)) for review. After the PR is approved, and the new Theme Kit version is released, merge the docs PR.

## 5. Update Theme Kit installation links on GitHub

> Note:
> Before proceeding with the remaining steps, consider waiting a day. If a defect is reported shortly after we make the release public, then we'll need to issue a patch release.

1. Update the manual installation links on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit/releases) and in the [main README](https://github.com/Shopify/themekit/blob/master/README.md).
2. Verify that the links work, as expected.

## 6. Update the Chocolately package

Update the Chocolatey package in the `choco` folder:

1. Update the version in `choco/themekit.nuspec`.
2. Update the version and checksums in `choco/tools/chocolateyinstall.ps1`.
3. Run `choco pack` in a window VM.
4. Log into [https://chocolatey.org/](chocolatey.org) (use `themekit@shopify.com` for your credentials) and submit an update for approval.

## 7. Update Theme Kit for Homebrew

Update the `themekit.rb` formula for Homebrew on [homebrew-shopify](https://github.com/Shopify/homebrew-shopify):

1. Run `make sha` to generate the SHA256 for the darwin build.
2. Update the link, SHA, and version in the Homebrew formula.
