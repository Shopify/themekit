Theme Kit is a cross-platform command line tool that you can use to build Shopify themes.

If you're working on Online Store 2.0 themes, you should use [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/cli), which replaces Theme Kit for most Shopify theme development tasks. You should use Theme Kit instead of Shopify CLI only if you're working on older themes.

## Features

With Theme Kit, you can use your own development tools to interact with the Shopify platform in the following ways:

- Use workflow tools like Git to work with a team of theme developers.
- Upload themes to multiple environments.
- Watch for local changes and upload them automatically to Shopify.
- Work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Install Theme Kit

You can install Theme Kit using the command line on the following operating systems:

- [Linux](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/getting-started#linux)
- [macOS](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/getting-started#macos)
- [Windows](https://shopify.dev/tools/theme-kit/getting-started#windows)

### Node package

If you want to integrate Theme Kit into your build process, then you can run the following `npm` command to install the [Node wrapper](https://github.com/Shopify/node-themekit) around Theme Kit:

``` terminal
$ npm install @shopify/themekit
```
